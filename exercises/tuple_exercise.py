# Access value 20 from below tuple
aTuple = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))

# Unpack the following tuple into 4 variables

# Expected output:
# Your code
# print(a) # should print 10
# print(b) # should print 20
# print(c) # should print 30
# print(d) # should print 40

# Modify the first item (22) of a list inside a following tuple to 222
tuple1 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
# Expected output:
# tuple1 = (11, [222, 33], 44, 55)

# Count the number of occurrences of item 50 from a tuple
tuple1 = (50, 10, 60, 70, 50)
# Expected output:
# 2

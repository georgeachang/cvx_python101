# Create a variable called skill_completed and set it equal to the string "Python Syntax".

# Create a variable called exercises_completed and set it equal to 13. Create another variable called points_per_exercise and set it equal to 5.

# Create a variable called point_total and set it equal to 100.

# Update point_total to be what it was before plus the result of multiplying exercises_completed and points_per_exercise.

# Add a comment above your declaration of points_per_exercise that says: The amount of points for each exercise may change, because points don't exist yet

# Print a string to the console that says: I got X points! with the value of point_total where X is.

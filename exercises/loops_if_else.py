# Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop
# Expected output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5
# 6
# 7
# 8
# 9
# 10

# Print multiplication table of given number
# For example num = 2 so the output should be
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
# 10
# 12
# 14
# 16
# 18
# 20

# Given a list iterate it and display numbers which are divisible by 5 and if you find number greater than 150 stop the loop iteration
list1 = [12, 15, 32, 42, 55, 75, 122, 132, 150, 180, 200]
# Expected output
# 15
# 55
# 75
# 150
# Reverse the following list using for loop
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
# Expected output:
# 50
# 40
# 30
# 20
# 10

# Write a loop to find the factorial of any number
# The factorial (symbol: !) means to multiply all whole numbers from our chosen number down to 1.
# For example: calculate the factorial of 5
num = 5
# 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
# Expected output:
# 120

# Write a function func1() such that it can accept a variable length of  argument and print all arguments value
# Expected Output:
# After func1(router, PHRCRG1):
# router
# PHRCRG1
# func1(10, 20, 30):
# 10
# 20
# 30

# Write a function calculation() such that it can accept two variables and calculate the addition and subtraction of it. And also it must return both addition and subtraction in a single return call
# For example:

def calculation(a, b):
    pass
    # Your Code
result = calculation(40, 10)
print(result)
# Expected Output: (50, 30)

# Create a function showDevice() in such a way that it should accept device name, and itâ€™s type and display both, and if the type is missing in function call it should show it as router
# Expected Output:

# showDevice("PHRCRG1")
# Should Produce:
# Device PHRCRG1 is a router
# Device PHRCRG1 is a router
